"A Proclamation on National Equal Pay Day, 2024

On National Equal Pay Day, we highlight the injustice of gender wage gaps by marking how far into this year women have to work, on average, to earn what men made last year.  Over a lifetime, these inequities can amount to millions of dollars lost for women who do not receive the wages they deserve.  Equal pay is about far more than a paycheck.  It is about living up to the fundamental values that define who we are as a Nation — equality, dignity, and fairness.  Today and every day, we continue working toward the promise of equal pay, recognizing that when women thrive, we all thrive.

Women’s labor force participation is the highest it has been in decades, and the gender pay gap is the narrowest it has ever been on record.  Yet, despite this progress, the fight for equal pay continues.  Women working full-time and year-round are paid an average of 84 cents for every dollar paid to men.  In more than 90 percent of occupations, women earn less than men — and these disparities are even greater for women of color and women with disabilities.  The pay gap is a product of the systemic barriers that women have long faced when it comes to accessing good-paying jobs and opportunities.  Further, caregiving responsibilities for children, loved ones with disabilities, and aging family members disproportionately fall on women, which can mean missing work, cutting hours, and leaving jobs.

America cannot have the strongest economy in the world while leaving women — half our workforce — behind.  When I came into office, women’s labor participation rate had fallen to its lowest level in more than three decades, in part because the COVID-19 pandemic had forced women out of the workforce to juggle caregiving responsibilities.  In response, my Administration’s American Rescue Plan invested billions of dollars to support working families, powering the strongest job creation in history.  The law also helped keep the doors open to 220,000 child care centers, 90 percent of which were owned and staffed by women.

Since I took office, nearly 15 million jobs have been created, and we are working relentlessly to ensure these jobs are accessible to women.  Across the major laws I have signed — such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is rebuilding our Nation; the CHIPS and Science Act, which is restoring our technological edge; and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is paving the way for a clean energy future — we are making sure women have a fair shot at securing the good-paying jobs being created.  For the first time, firms receiving significant Federal dollars will be required to ensure they have high-quality child care available to their workers.  I have signed a sweeping Executive Order that includes more than 50 directives to expand access to affordable, high-quality care and provide support for care workers and family caregivers.  Additionally, I signed legislation that provides new protections for pregnant and nursing workers.  This past year, the Small Business Administration delivered $5.1 billion in loans to women-owned businesses.

To advance pay equity, my Administration has committed to leading by example and making the Federal Government a model employer.  That is why we have taken action to close persistent wage gaps.  We finalized a rule ensuring that Federal agencies no longer consider an applicant’s current or past pay when determining their future salaries — eliminating pay inequities that can otherwise follow workers from job to job.  My Administration has proposed regulations to advance pay equity and pay transparency for workers on Federal contracts.

We are making tremendous progress, but there is still much more we must do.  My Administration continues to call on the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act — commonsense legislation that would increase pay transparency and give workers more tools to fight sex-based pay discrimination.

On National Equal Pay Day, let us redouble our efforts to ensure that women get the pay they have earned and deserve.  Let us recommit to giving our daughters the same opportunities as our sons.  Let us remember our responsibility to live up to our Nation’s fundamental values of equality, dignity, and fairness for all Americans.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 12, 2024, as National Equal Pay Day.  I call upon all Americans to recognize the full value of women’s skills and their significant contributions to the labor force, acknowledge the injustice of wage inequality, and join efforts to achieve equal pay.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.","President Biden's proclamation for National Equal Pay Day 2024 highlights the ongoing commitment to addressing the gender wage gap, emphasizing equal pay as a reflection of the nation's values. It details progress, ongoing disparities, and comprehensive efforts under his administration to support women in the workforce and promote wage equality, alongside a call for legislative action to further these goals.",,,,,
"Press Release: Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701‑1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iran.  On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959, imposing more comprehensive sanctions on Iran to further respond to this threat.  On August 19, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13059, consolidating and clarifying those previous orders.  The President took additional steps pursuant to this national emergency in Executive Order 13553 of September 28, 2010; Executive Order 13574 of May 23, 2011; Executive Order 13590 of November 20, 2011; Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012; Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012; Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012; Executive Order 13622 of July 30, 2012; Executive Order 13628 of October 9, 2012; Executive Order 13645 of June 3, 2013; Executive Order 13716 of January 16, 2016, which revoked Executive Orders 13574, 13590, 13622, 13645, and provisions of Executive Order 13628; Executive Order 13846 of August 6, 2018, which revoked Executive Orders 13716 and 13628; Executive Order 13871 of May 8, 2019; Executive Order 13876 of June 24, 2019; Executive Order 13902 of January 10, 2020; and Executive Order 13949 of September 21, 2020.

     The actions and policies of the Government of Iran — including its proliferation and development of missiles and other asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities, its network and campaign of regional aggression, its support for terrorist groups, and the malign activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its surrogates — continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

     For these reasons, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 2024.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Iran declared in Executive Order 12957.  The emergency declared by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, in connection with the hostage crisis.  This renewal, therefore, is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 7, 2023.

     This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.","The U.S. has extended the national emergency regarding Iran, first declared in 1995, due to ongoing threats to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy from Iran's government actions, including weapon proliferation, regional aggression, and support for terrorism. This extension underscores the severity and persistence of the threat, justifying continued sanctions and countermeasures.",,,,,
"A Proclamation on U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day, 2024

Today — and every day — the United States reaffirms our sacred pledge to American hostages and detainees wrongfully held abroad:  We see you.  We stand with you.  We will not stop working until you are home and reunited with your family.

     This has been a priority for my Administration since day one — and we have made important progress.  Over the last 3 years, we have brought home more than 60 Americans being held hostage or wrongfully detained around the world, including from Afghanistan, Burma, Gaza, Haiti, Iran, Russia, Rwanda, Venezuela, West Africa, and more.  But we have much more work to do.  Too many Americans remain illegally and wrongfully detained, fearing for their lives and not knowing what tomorrow will bring.  Too many families remain ripped apart, living in agony and uncertainty every day their loved one remains wrongfully held abroad.  No family — and no American — should have to endure this suffering and separation.

     That is why my Administration has taken unprecedented action to secure the release of all Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad.  In 2022, I signed an Executive Order to strengthen our efforts to address the scourge of hostage-taking and wrongful detention, including issuing more severe consequences for actors that illegally detain American citizens and attempt to use human beings as bargaining chips.  Last year, we issued the first-ever sanctions against actors — including in Russia and Iran — for engaging in this abhorrent practice.  My Administration has also focused on preventing these cases from occurring in the first place.  We have joined 74 nations around the world and the European Union in endorsing the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention.  Finally, we have focused on providing families with loved ones held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad with the resources and support services they deserve.

     Here at home, the Department of State launched a risk indictor that warns travelers if there is a high threat of wrongful detention at their destination.  For more information on travel advisories, go to travel.state.gov.

     As President, I have no higher duty than ensuring the safety and security of my fellow Americans — including all those who remain held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad.  I will continue to work to bring them home.  I will continue to leverage every resource to punish and deter actors who engage in this despicable and unacceptable practice.  I will not stop these efforts until every American is accounted for and safely back home.  Today — and every day — that is my pledge.

     The Congress, by Public Law 118-31 approved December 22, 2023, has designated March 9 of each year as “U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day.”

     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 9, 2024, as U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day.  On this day, as we fly the Hostage and Wrongful Detainee flag at the White House, I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with relevant programs, ceremonies, and activities.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.","President Biden's proclamation for U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day 2024 reaffirms the administration's dedication to bringing home Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. It highlights the progress made, outlines measures to combat and prevent such detentions, and pledges continuous efforts to ensure the safety and return of detained Americans, marking a national commitment to standing against wrongful detention worldwide.",,,,,
"Executive Order on Scaling and Expanding the Use of Registered Apprenticeships in Industries and the Federal Government and Promoting Labor-Management Forums

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

     Section 1.  Policy.  My Administration’s Investing in America agenda includes a once-in-a-generation investment in our Nation’s infrastructure.  This agenda is also driving the creation of well-paying jobs and growing the economy sustainably and equitably, and it will continue to do so for decades to come.  To fully realize the benefits of these investments, students and workers at all stages of life need equitable access to education and training for the good jobs in their communities.

     Critical to achieving these goals is promoting Registered Apprenticeships, as described in title 29, parts 29 and 30, of the Code of Federal Regulations, which provide substantial benefits to both workers and employers.  As the Nation’s largest employer and procurer of goods and services, the Federal Government can be a model for the use and promotion of skills-based hiring, such as the use of Registered Apprenticeships, which reduces barriers to employment and attracts a diverse workforce to meet our Nation’s critical needs.  My Administration has made strengthening and empowering the Federal workforce a management priority.  As a part of its overall strategy to hire, retain, and develop the people needed to accomplish executive department and agency (agency) missions and to create equitable, transparent, and transferable career-development pathways, the Federal Government can scale and expand Registered Apprenticeship programs to modernize and broaden avenues to Federal jobs, thereby improving access to opportunities for underserved workers.

     Additionally, Labor-Management Forums provide an opportunity for managers, employees, and employees’ union representatives to discuss how Federal Government operations can promote satisfactory labor relations and improve the productivity and effectiveness of the Federal Government.  Labor-Management Forums, as complements to the existing collective bargaining process, allow managers and employees to collaborate in order to continue to deliver the highest quality goods and services to the American people.

     It is the policy of my Administration to promote Registered Apprenticeships to meet employer needs while investing in workers’ skills; reducing employment barriers; and promoting job quality, equity, inclusion, and accessibility for the benefit of the Federal Government and the Nation.  Further, it is the policy of my Administration to establish cooperative and productive labor-management relations throughout the executive branch.

     Sec. 2.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:

     (a)  The term “Registered Apprenticeship” means an industry-driven career pathway through which employers can develop and prepare their future workforces and individuals can obtain paid training, work experience, progressive wage increases, classroom instruction, and a portable, nationally recognized credential.

     (b)  The term “Pre-Apprenticeship” has the meaning set forth in 29 C.F.R. 30.2.

     (c)  The term “Labor-Management Forum” means a nonadversarial forum for managers, employees, and employees’ union representatives to discuss how Federal Government operations can promote satisfactory labor relations and improve the productivity and effectiveness of the Federal Government.

     Sec. 4.  Procurement and Grants.  (a)  Agencies shall review their Federal financial assistance programs and procurement plans and identify where, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, they could include requirements, application evaluation factors, or incentives in appropriate program documents or solicitations for grantees or contractors to employ workers on projects receiving Federal funding who are participating in, or who have completed, either a Registered Apprenticeship or Pre-Apprenticeship.

  (b)  Agencies shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, apply the requirements, application evaluation factors, or incentives that they have identified pursuant to the review conducted in subsection (a) of this section in appropriate program documents or solicitations for grantees or contractors.
