# quotientai
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/quotientai)](https://pypi.org/project/quotientai)

## Overview

`quotientai` is an SDK and CLI built to manage artifacts (prompts, datasets), and run evaluations on [Quotient](https://quotientai.co).

## Installation

```console
pip install quotientai
```

## Usage

Create an API key on Quotient and set it as an environment variable called `QUOTIENT_API_KEY`. Then follow the examples below or see our [docs](https://docs.quotientai.co) for a more comprehensive walkthrough.

### Examples

**Create a prompt:**

```python
from quotientai import QuotientAI

quotient = QuotientAI()

new_prompt = quotient.prompts.create(
    name="customer-support-inquiry"
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    user_prompt="How can I assist you today?"
)

print(new_prompt)
```

**Create a dataset:**

```python
from quotientai import QuotientAI

quotient = QuotientAI()

new_dataset = quotient.datasets.create(
    name="my-sample-dataset"
    description="My first dataset",
    rows=[
        {"input": "Sample input", "expected": "Sample output"},
        {"input": "Another input", "expected": "Another output"}
    ]
)

print(new_dataset)
```

**Create a log with hallucination detection:**
Log an event with hallucination detection. This will create a log event in Quotient and perform hallucination detection on the model output, input, and documents. This is a fire and forget operation, so it will not block the execution of your code.

Additional examples can be found in the [examples](examples) directory.

```python
from quotientai import QuotientAI

quotient = QuotientAI()
quotient_logger = quotient.logger.init(
    # Required
    app_name="my-app",
    environment="dev",
    # dynamic labels for slicing/dicing analytics e.g. by customer, feature, etc
    tags={"model": "gpt-4o", "feature": "customer-support"},
    hallucination_detection=True,
    inconsistency_detection=True,
)

# Mock retrieved documents
retrieved_documents = [{"page_content": "Sample document"}]

response = quotient_logger.log(
    user_query="Sample input",
    model_output="Sample output",
    # Page content from Documents from your retriever used to generate the model output
    documents=[doc["page_content"] for doc in retrieved_documents],
    # Message history from your chat history
    message_history=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on geography."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of France is Paris"},
    ],
    # Instructions for the model to follow
    instructions=[
        "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about the world.",
        "Answer the question in a concise manner. If you are not sure, say 'I don't know'.",
    ],
    # Tags can be overridden at log time
    tags={"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "feature": "customer-support"},
)

print(response)
```

You can also use the async client if you need to create logs asynchronously.

```python
from quotientai import AsyncQuotientAI
import asyncio

quotient = AsyncQuotientAI()

quotient_logger = quotient.logger.init(
    # Required
    app_name="my-app",
    environment="dev",
    # dynamic labels for slicing/dicing analytics e.g. by customer, feature, etc
    tags={"model": "gpt-4o", "feature": "customer-support"},
    hallucination_detection=True,
    inconsistency_detection=True,
)


async def main():
    # Mock retrieved documents
    retrieved_documents = [{"page_content": "Sample document"}]

    response = await quotient_logger.log(
        user_query="Sample input",
        model_output="Sample output",
        # Page content from Documents from your retriever used to generate the model output
        documents=[doc["page_content"] for doc in retrieved_documents],
        # Message history from your chat history
        message_history=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on geography."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of France is Paris"},
        ],
        # Instructions for the model to follow
        instructions=[
            "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about the world.",
            "Answer the question in a concise manner. If you are not sure, say 'I don't know'.",
        ],
        # Tags can be overridden at log time
        tags={"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "feature": "customer-support"},
    )

    print(response)


# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```
