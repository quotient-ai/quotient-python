We compare performance between OpenAI's `o1` model and DeepSeek's `R1` model. Each model will be given the same, generic question-answering prompt, where they will be provided with context from the tax form instructions as well as a question."

    "Across nearly all metrics, `DeepSeek-R1` considerably outperforms OpenAI's `o1` model. Both models are fairly verbose, indicating that the `max_tokens` parameter can be lowered (though this may risk incomplete model responses due to the tokens used during reasoning). Interestingly, `o1` outperforms `DeepSeek-R1` in the faithfulness metric. To better understand why, let's look at the worst performing rows on `faithfulness_selfcheckgpt` for each model."

       "      <td>If you want to include your **nontaxable combat pay** in your **Earned Income Credit (EIC)** calculation, you can choose to do so by making an election on your tax return. Including nontaxable combat pay may increase or decrease your EIC, so it's important to calculate the credit both ways to determine which option is more beneficial for you.\\n\\nHere are the steps you should follow:\\n\\n1. **Locate Your Nontaxable Combat Pay Amount:**\\n   - Find your Form W-2 from your military employer.\\n   - Look for Box 12 with Code Q; this box reports your nontaxable combat pay.\\n\\n2. **Calculate the EIC Both Ways:**\\n   - **Without Nontaxable Combat Pay:**\\n     - Use your earned income excluding nontaxable combat pay.\\n     - Complete the EIC Worksheet (usually found in the IRS instructions for Form 1040) using this amount.\\n   - **With Nontaxable Combat Pay:**\\n     - Add your nontaxable combat pay to your earned income.\\n     - Complete a second EIC Worksheet using this new total.\\n\\n3. **Compare the Results:**\\n   - Determine which calculation provides a higher EIC amount.\\n\\n4. **Make the Election:**\\n   - If including the nontaxable combat pay results in a higher EIC (or if you prefer to include it for any reason), you can elect to include it.\\n   - On your tax return (Form 1040), there is a designated line or checkbox to indicate this election. For the correct placement:\\n     - Refer to the instructions for the specific tax year you are filing, as line numbers may change.\\n     - Typically, you will enter the amount of your nontaxable combat pay on the line labeled \"Nontaxable combat pay election.\"\\n\\n5. **Complete Your Tax Return:**\\n   - Continue filling out your tax return using the information from the EIC Worksheet that includes your elected nontaxable combat pay, if you've chosen to include it.\\n   - Attach any required forms or schedules as instructed.\\n\\n**Additional Tips:**\\n\\n- **Documentation:** Keep a copy of both calculations for your records, even though only one will be submitted with your tax return.\\n- **Software Assistance:** If you are using tax preparation software, it often can compute the EIC both ways automatically when you enter your nontaxable combat pay.

       "36  If you want to include your **nontaxable combat pay** in your **Earned Income Credit (EIC)** calculation, you can choose to do so by making an election on your tax return. Including nontaxable combat pay may increase or decrease your EIC, so it's important to calculate the credit both ways to determine which option is more beneficial for you.\\n\\nHere are the steps you should follow:\\n\\n1. **Locate Your Nontaxable Combat Pay Amount:**\\n   - Find your Form W-2 from your military employer.\\n   - Look for Box 12 with Code Q; this box reports your nontaxable combat pay.\\n\\n2. **Calculate the EIC Both Ways:**\\n   - **Without Nontaxable Combat Pay:**\\n     - Use your earned income excluding nontaxable combat pay.\\n     - Complete the EIC Worksheet (usually found in the IRS instructions for Form 1040) using this amount.\\n   - **With Nontaxable Combat Pay:**\\n     - Add your nontaxable combat pay to your earned income.\\n     - Complete a second EIC Worksheet using this new total.\\n\\n3. **Compare the Results:**\\n   - Determine which calculation provides a higher EIC amount.\\n\\n4. **Make the Election:**\\n   - If including the nontaxable combat pay results in a higher EIC (or if you prefer to include it for any reason), you can elect to include it.\\n   - On your tax return (Form 1040), there is a designated line or checkbox to indicate this election. For the correct placement:\\n     - Refer to the instructions for the specific tax year you are filing, as line numbers may change.\\n     - Typically, you will enter the amount of your nontaxable combat pay on the line labeled \"Nontaxable combat pay election.\"\\n\\n5. **Complete Your Tax Return:**\\n   - Continue filling out your tax return using the information from the EIC Worksheet that includes your elected nontaxable combat pay, if you've chosen to include it.\\n   - Attach any required forms or schedules as instructed.\\n\\n**Additional Tips:**\\n\\n- **Documentation:** Keep a copy of both calculations for your records, even though only one will be submitted with your tax return.\\n- **Software Assistance:** If you are using tax preparation software, it often can compute the EIC both ways automatically when you enter your nontaxable combat pay.

Exceeding these limits disqualifies you from the credit.\\n\\n4. **Documentation**:  \\n   If you elect to include combat pay, no special form is required. Simply include it in your earned income calculation. Retain documentation of your combat pay (e.g., Leave and Earnings Statement) in case of an IRS inquiry.\\n\\n**Why This Matters**:  \\nIncluding nontaxable combat pay can sometimes increase your EIC, but it depends on your income level and family size.

Your income of $40,000 exceeds this threshold, disqualifying you from the credit.\\n\\n2. **Roth IRA Contributions Qualify**:  \\n   While contributions to a Roth IRA are eligible for the credit, the income limit is the critical barrier here. Other disqualifiers (e.g., being a dependent, student status, or age) do not apply based on the information provided.\\n\\n**Next Steps**:  \\n- Review your AGI (line 11 of Form 1040) to confirm it is indeed $40,000.  \\n- If your income is close to the threshold in future years, contributions to retirement accounts (like a traditional IRA) could reduce your AGI and potentially make you eligible.  \\n\\nFor more details, see [IRS Form 8880](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8880.pdf) or [Tax Topic 610](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc610.html).</td>\n",

       "36  \\n\\nTo include nontaxable combat pay in your Earned Income Credit (EIC) calculation, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Compare Both Scenarios**:  \\n   - Calculate your EIC **with** nontaxable combat pay included in earned income.  \\n   - Calculate your EIC **without** including nontaxable combat pay.  \\n   - Use whichever method results in a **higher credit**.\\n\\n2. **How to Include Combat Pay**:  \\n   - Add your nontaxable combat pay to your earned income on **Line 4** of the worksheet.  \\n   - Combine this amount with other earned income on **Line 5** to determine your total earned income for EIC purposes.\\n\\n3. **Check Income Limits**:  \\n   Ensure your total earned income (including combat pay, if elected) does not exceed the EIC income thresholds for your filing status and number of qualifying children (listed in **Question 3** of the context). Exceeding these limits disqualifies you from the credit.\\n\\n4. **Documentation**:  \\n   If you elect to include combat pay, no special form is required. Simply include it in your earned income calculation. Retain documentation of your combat pay (e.g., Leave and Earnings Statement) in case of an IRS inquiry.\\n\\n**Why This Matters**:  \\nIncluding nontaxable combat pay can sometimes increase your EIC, but it depends on your income level and family size. Always verify both scenarios to maximize your benefit. If you’re unsure, use the IRS’s EIC Assistant tool or consult a tax professional.   \n",
       "47  \\n\\n**Answer:**  \\nNo, you cannot claim the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit (Saver's Credit) in this scenario. Here's why:\\n\\n1. **Income Limit Exceeded**:  \\n   For single filers in 2024, the Saver's Credit is unavailable if your **adjusted gross income (AGI)** on Form 1040, line 11, exceeds **$38,250**. Your income of $40,000 exceeds this threshold, disqualifying you from the credit.\\n\\n2. **Roth IRA Contributions Qualify**:  \\n   While contributions to a Roth IRA are eligible for the credit, the income limit is the critical barrier here. Other disqualifiers (e.g., being a dependent, student status, or age) do not apply based on the information provided.\\n\\n**Next Steps**:  \\n- Review your AGI (line 11 of Form 1040) to confirm it is indeed $40,000.  \\n- If your income is close to the threshold in future years, contributions to retirement accounts (like a traditional IRA) could reduce your AGI and potentially make you eligible.  \\n\\nFor more details, see [IRS Form 8880](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8880.pdf) or [Tax Topic 610](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc610.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
